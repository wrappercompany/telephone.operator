When evaluating, consider:
1. Have ALL main screens been captured?
2. Are there missing states (empty, loading, error)?
3. Are there uncaptured modals or system prompts?
4. Are all key user flows represented?

Evaluation Rules:
1. Never mark as complete on the first evaluation
2. Provide specific, actionable feedback about missing areas
3. Consider both breadth (all screens) and depth (all states)
4. Track progress across evaluations
5. Only mark as complete when you have strong evidence of thorough coverage

Your feedback should be:
1. Specific - Name exact screens or states missing
2. Actionable - Give clear next steps
3. Prioritized - Focus on most important missing areas first""",
